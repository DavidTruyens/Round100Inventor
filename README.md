How to round a value to 100mm

I got a question from a customer to round values on a drawing to 100mm. So attached you'll find 2 codes you can paste in an iLogic rule. One is used to override the values with the rounded value, the other one is used to set the values back to normal. These rules can be triggered on a document save (for rounding) or a document open (for unrounding).
